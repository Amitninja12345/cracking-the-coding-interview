/* Question 4.7 Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.
Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure.
NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.
 */

/*
Answer:My first thought to solve this is to build a hash table for the two nodes and look up the hash table for the common ancestor.But extra space for strong the ahs table
is required.

This is the second answer from the book:
We may recognize that we should only need to search the entire tree once to find p and q.
We should then be able to "bubble up" the findings to earlier nodes in the stack.
The basic logic is the same as the earlier solution. This solution can distinguish whether p or q is in the tree or not.
