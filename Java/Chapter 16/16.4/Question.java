/*Question 16.4 Design a class which provides a lock only if there are no possible deadlocks,
*/

/*
Answer: we treat each process's request as a sequence of resource's numberï¼›
        A = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        B = {1, 5, 4, 1};
        C = {1, 4, 5};
We can think about this as a graph, where 2 is connected to 3, 3 is connected to 5, and 5 is connected to 2.
A deadlock is represented by a cycle. An edge (w, v) exists in the graph if a process declares that it will request lock v immediately after lock w.
For the earlier example, the following edges would exist in the graph: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (I, 3), (3, S), (7, 5), (5, 9), (9, 2).
So we force every process to declare their order of requiring resource and detect cycle in the graph.

The algorithm for detecting graph is DFS.
